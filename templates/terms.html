                    <h6>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h6>
                    <p>
                        Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction
                        by contacting us (link). This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver provision (“Provision”)
                        facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and TriWellRI
                        Parties as defined below. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with
                        a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead
                        submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. Please read
                        this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and TriWellRI Parties shall be
                        resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of
                        this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court,
                        before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others
                        (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this
                        agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by
                        a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award
                        is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as
                        a court (including attorneys’ fees). For the purpose of this Provision, “TriWellRI Parties.” means
                        TriWellRI, LLC, and its parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective
                        officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy
                        between you and TriWellRI Parties regarding any aspect of your relationship with TriWellRI Parties
                        whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud,
                        misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory,
                        and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability
                        of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning
                        that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or
                        products provided or billed to you (such as TriWellRI Parties’ licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party
                        vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT
                        AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED
                        ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING
                        ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

                    <p>
                        Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give the TriWellRI
                        Parties an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written
                        notification to TriWellRI at Contact Us (link). That written notification must include (1) your name,
                        (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific
                        relief you seek. If any of the Bulletproof Parties does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after
                        it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.

                    <p>
                        If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you
                        or the relevant TriWellRI Parties may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration
                        Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the
                        arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an
                        individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall
                        be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. For arbitration before AAA,
                        for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes
                        will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
                        In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The
                        AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS,
                        the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery
                        Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com
                        or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable
                        arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
                        Because these websites and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)
                        governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive
                        law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
                        Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available
                        pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit
                        of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing
                        but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final
                        and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered
                        in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement. Location of Arbitration
                        – You or TriWellRI Parties may initiate arbitration in either Rhode Island or the federal judicial
                        district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district
                        that includes your billing address, any of the TriWellRI Parties may transfer the arbitration to
                        Rhode Island in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result
                        of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – The relevant
                        TriWellRI Parties will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your
                        written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional
                        fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert
                        witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any
                        rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good
                        faith with TriWellRI as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and
                        the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled
                        to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.

                    <p>
                        The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class
                        or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney
                        general action) unless both you and all of the relevant Bulletproof Parties specifically agree to
                        do so following initiation of the arbitration.

                        trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and TriWellRI
                        Parties might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge
                        or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class
                        actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would
                        have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be
                        more limited or may also be waived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Severability If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal
                        or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision
                        will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or
                        unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.

                        This Provision shall survive the termination of your account or other relationship with the TriWellRI Parties. Notwithstanding
                        any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if TriWellRI makes any change to this
                        Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require
                        the TriWellRI Parties to adhere to the language in this Provision if a Dispute between you and the
                        Bulletproof Parties arises.
